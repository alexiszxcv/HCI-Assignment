# Hello World with OpenAI API

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use OpenAI's generative AI API to produce a creative "Hello World" message.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- An OpenAI account and API key

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexiszxcv/HCI-Assignment.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd project_directory
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

## Running the Application

Execute the script using:
```bash
python hello_world.py
```

You should see a creatively generated "Hello World" message printed in your terminal.

## Reflection
This exercise provided insightful exposure to working with APIs, specifically highlighting the ease and capability of integrating generative AI into applications. Initially, the project required adaptation to updates in OpenAI's API, emphasizing the importance of regularly consulting official documentation and maintaining flexible coding practices.

The simplicity yet creativity of this "Hello World" example showcases the potential for leveraging generative AI in future applications, particularly in creating personalized, interactive, and dynamic user experiences.
